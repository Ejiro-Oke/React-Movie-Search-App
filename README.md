# React-Movie-Search-App
React Movie Search App is my take on the Scrimba project of the same name with React.
The user is able to type in a query, which (on submission) is going to make a call to The Movie Database API to retrieve data (movies and information about movies) which will be presented back to the user. Here are some methods implemented to this simple project to life:
* Function-based React components
* React Hooks
* Async & await
* Fetch().
